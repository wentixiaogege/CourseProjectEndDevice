Course Project End Device Part 
========================

Summary:
------------------------

This project is mainly about how to use RESTful web service in the IOT project ,basically It is how to set up a running system with both a device get the real data and a  server store and display the data. I will talk in detail about how to set up the running system first, and then I will talk about how the hardware and software 's functions and how they work together. which works together out-of-the-box.

The System Architecture:
------------------------

              
            1st Level       Web Browser 
     
                              |     |
            2nd Level       RESTful Server
                             |        |
                            |          |
            3rd Level  End Device   End Device


setting up the system 
------------------------
Then I am going to talk about how to make the system work , be sure you have downloaded all the code  !! and import them in the eclipse projects , by the way I am using eclipse for setting up this system not in the raspberry but in my local PC .If you really want to programming in the raspberry pi ,you can do it ,but I am sure it is very slow .you can use my projects also ,cause you still can use maven in the raspberry pi. I am going to lead you guys from both hardware and software side.

 Hardware:

1. the raspberry OS:
	The first is you need to install and configure the system in the raspberry pi ,which using as SD card as its memeory and storage ,I am 		not going to talk about how to install the r aspberry OS here you can find more tutorials here: https://www.raspberrypi.org
	2.The connection of the DHT11 temp sensor and the device 
	2.1 connect temp sensor
	you need three wires to get data from the DHT11 sensor, which is power/ground/data .below is my connection:
                              
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/temp_connection.png)                                               


I mainly get the inspiration from this website: http://hirt.se/blog/?p=493









2.2 connect the relay device
       relay something is just like relay a led device ,you only need to wires to relay a device which is state and ground: connection like below:
             
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/relay_connection.png)   










 


  

3.the xbee connection :
  	 for the xbee connection you may need using XCTU for confire the xbee :
		http://www.libelium.com/development/waspmote/	documentation/x-ctu-tutorial/
   	 for how to configure the xbee different mode learn form here:
 		http://www.arduino-hacks.com/xbee-api-mode/
	  	below is my configure: 
1. for end device:
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/xbee_end.png)   
















2. for server device:
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/xbee_server.png)


















after you plugin the xbee device into your system use command below:
             ls /dev/tty
	you will get a device named 
          “ttyUSB*” * means numbers:

 
Software:
------------

After the hardware part is done! You need to install some libraries and configure to make the system runing.

1.install DHT-11 driver :(optional in server part)
	download code from here:   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/tree/master/Adafruit_DHT_Driver 
	cd into this folder and then using the command  : make 
	you will get a runnable file Adafruit_DHT;put it into you PATH environment.
 
2.install jdk8
	download  form here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-arm-downloads-2187472.html
	unzip it into somewhere I installed it in /opt/java 
	cd /opt/java/yourjdkversion/
	sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/java/yourjdkversion/java" 1
	sudo update-alternatives --set java /opt/java/yourjdkversion/bin/java

   open /etc/profile add those lines in the bottom:


   export JAVA_HOME=/opt/ yourjdkversion
   export JRE_HOME=$JAVA_HOME/jre 
   export CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/lib:$JRE_HOME/lib 
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH 
   
   Now you should be able to execute java

3.install java serial tools
 	You can install RXTX like this:
		$ sudo apt-get install librxtx-java

4.set up the end device part 
	Be sure you have download maven2 .if you haven't run below command in the command line:
	
         	sudo apt-get install maven2
         	
   Be sure you have download 
   CourseProject : 
		https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProject   ;
   CourseProjectEndDevice: 
		https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice;
   import those projects into your eclipse you will see all the avaibleable code,make sure there is no error show up.
       
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/eclipse_end_init.png)             





   cd to the CourseProject folder and then run below:
   
   mvn clean install 
                         
   cd to the CourseProjectEndDevice folder and then run below :
   
   mvn clean install 
   
   everything shoul went well and then you will get a XXXX.jar package like below:

![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/eclipse_end_compiled.png)                        







copy and paste this XXXX.jar package into your raspberry OS system anywhere you want and run the below command:

   sudo java -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni/ -jar yourpackagename.jar 

and you are set .!!!!!!!


Usage of the System:
---------------------

next, I will tell in detail about how to change or modify functions in  the end device part.
For how to modify or change function in the server part goto :
	https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectV1
 
 
1 change the end device part for your own usage

   Till now ,I assume you already have set up the end device part of the system (including the hardware and software ). If not please check my another tutorial for how to set up the whole system .

1.1 change the sensor's GPIO

    I assume that you know that we are using DHT!! temperature sensor to get data based on previous tutorial , and on your own raspberry pi you can use below command :
	  sudo Adafruit  11 4 
  to get the temperature and humidity data like this:
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/adafruit.png) 

 if you want to change the GPIO number of the device ,below is mine:
 
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/temp_connection.png)   

from this picture ,you can change to other pins, if you can see the bold numbers around the edge,which is  the pi4j pin numbers :
      for now I am using    RaspiPin.GPIO_12 this one.
![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/pi4j_gpio.png)

I got  above picture from here:

http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/1127462/25655475/1415663597223/rpi-java-8-savage-devoxx.pdf?token=%2BGcc6%2FnUUkzdrjwJpKcdsFvv%2FtU%3D  

  then to change the pin number:
  go to :/src/main/resourese/xbee.properties  to change the relayPinNum 
  ![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/property.png)
  
  
1.2 getting the humidity data other than temperature data

 for now we are getting temperature data here,if you want to change reading temperature to humidity data  
go to :yourprojectfolder/src/main/java/XbeeListener.java 
  find sendXbeeData function
  ![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/sendXbeeData.png)
  
  just change the sensor.getTemperature() into sensor.getHumidity() will be okay!

1.3 using other sensor or device

  if you are going to use other sensors other than this DHT11. Happily is that you can still use DHT22 ,DallasSensors with this library.
  
  Let's say you have a DHT22 sensor want to use in this project, 
   go to CourseProject-folder/src/main/resourses/dhtsensors.properties :
   (in my github folder https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProject/blob/master/src/main/resources/dhtsensors.properties)
    ![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/dhtsensor.png)
  
  modify the pin value and sensor type:(like below)
 
   ![alt tag](https://github.com/wentixiaogege/CourseProjectEndDevice/blob/master/readme_img/usingdht22.png)
	
  then you can use it.
